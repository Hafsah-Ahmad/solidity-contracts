 📁 Contracts Folder

This folder contains Solidity practice contracts created to understand key foundational concepts like function visibility, inheritance, and internal logic.

Included Contracts

1.HelloWorld.sol=
- A basic contract that returns a simple "Hello World" message.
- Concepts practiced:
  - string data type
  - Return values

2.Public Private Function access.sol=
- Demonstrates the use of public functions to access private functions.
- Concepts practiced:
  - Calling private functions externally by using public functions.
  - Accessing private data and methods from outside the contract

3.InternalFunction.sol=
- Focuses on internal function behavior.
- Concepts practiced:
  - Internal function declaration
  - Accessing internal functions within the contract or via inheritance
  - 
4. Inheritance.sol=
- Shows how Solidity contracts can inherit functionality.
- Concepts practiced:
  - Base and derived contracts
  - Function overriding
 
5. IfElse.sol=
- Demonstrates if-else conditional logic to check number types.
- Concepts practiced:
  - Conditional statements
  - Pure functions
  - Function returns based on conditions

6. ForLoop.sol=
- Uses a for loop to calculate a sum of numbers from 1 to 5.
- Concepts practiced:
  - for loop
  - State variable updates
  - Loop iteration logic
 
7. WhileLoop.sol=
- Uses a while loop to calculate a sum of numbers from 0 to 5.
- Concepts practiced:
  - while loop
  - State variable updates
  - Loop termination conditions
    
8. FixedArray.sol=
  -Stores a fixed-size array of 5 student names.
  -Two methods to insert values:
  -Manually assigning each index.
  -Using a for loop and a memory array.
  -Concepts practiced:
  -Fixed-size arrays
  -Array indexing
  -Memory keyword usage
  -for loop

9.DynamicArray.sol=
  -Uses a dynamic array to store and manage student names.
  -Names added using push() and removed using pop().
  - Concepts practiced:
  -Dynamic arrays
  -push() and pop() methods
  -Array manipulation at runtime

10.SimpleMapping.sol=
- Uses a basic "mapping(uint => string)" to store student names by roll number.
- Concepts practiced:
  - Basic mappings
  - Key-value storage
  - Memory keyword for strings

11.MappingWithStruct.sol=
- Stores detailed student information (name, age, phone) using a custom `struct`.
- Concepts practiced:
  - Struct definition and usage
  - Mapping from "uint => struct"
  - Struct initialization with named fields

  
How to Use=
You can copy each of these contracts into [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), compile, and deploy them individually for testing and practice.

Learning Focus=
These contracts help build understanding of:
- Visibility modifiers (`public`, `internal`)
- State variables and simple logic
- Contract inheritance and modular design
